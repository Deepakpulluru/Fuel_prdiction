Machine Learning for Fuel Consumption Prediction and Driving Profile
Overview
This project focuses on predicting vehicle fuel consumption and analyzing driving profiles using machine learning. The repository includes a base research paper, the complete source code for a Python-based web application, project documentation, and presentation slides.

The core of the project is a machine learning model integrated into a web application, allowing users to input data and receive predictions.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following main directories:

/ABSTRACT: Contains the project abstract (ABSTRACT.docx).

/BASEPAPER: Contains the foundational research paper for this project (Machine_Learning.pdf).

/CODE-Modified:

/FRONTEND: Contains the main Python web application (e.g., app.py).

/templates: Holds the HTML files for the web interface (e.g., login.html, prediction.html).

/static: Stores static assets like images, fonts, and JavaScript files.

/DOCUMENT:

/OUTPUT SREENS: Contains screenshots of the running application (e.g., graph.png, userhome.png).

/PPT: Contains presentation slides related to the project (e.g., Fuel Comsumption (Initial).pptx).

Technology Stack
Backend: Python (likely using the Flask framework, based on app.py)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Machine Learning: Python-based ML libraries (details would be in the requirements.txt or code).

How to Run
To run the web application locally, navigate to the CODE-Modified/FRONTEND directory:

Navigate to the code directory:

cd "CODE-Modified/FRONTEND"
Install dependencies (Assuming a requirements.txt file exists):


pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:



python app.py
Open your web browser and go to the address provided (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000).
